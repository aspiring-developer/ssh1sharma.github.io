# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is a workday scheduler created by using Javascript and jQuery.
- I started this project with desining a sample visual layout with html and css.
- Then taking that design as a reference, I started Javascript coding to create necessary elements and styled them.
- I then worked on further functionality of the app by coding more. 
- The code worked, but there was more than 200 lines of codes that did not make me happy, so with my tutor's help I was able to shortened the codes. The tutor asked me to use loops and functions to do so. By using the tutor, I learned many things necessary for Javascript coding.
- Finally, I am happy with the final result.
