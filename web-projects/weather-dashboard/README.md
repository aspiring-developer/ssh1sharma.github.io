# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard was built using a third-party server-side API called Open Weather API. 
## Functionality:
- When it loads to the browser, user can enter a city name of their choice and get some of the main information about weather.
- It will display the data such as city name, today's date, temperature in Fahrenheit and Kelvin, humidity, wind speed, UV index on the top right field.
- There is also a dynamic weather image-icon field on the field.
- Similarly, this app is able to show 5-day forecast of the searched city on the bottom section where user can see dates, weather related icons, temperature in fahrenheit and humidity percentage. 
- This app is also able to save the searched city name(s) as a list. The list is stored in browser's local storage. The list will display in the top left section, below the search field.
- This project was a great learning opportunity! After doing this, I have built some confidentiality working with Javascript, jQuery and AJAX.
