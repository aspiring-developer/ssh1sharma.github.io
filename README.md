# Updated-Portfolio
This website is a personal version. It includes all of my works: web development, graphic design, digital drawing, oil painting, chalkboard arts.
Since this site is at WIP phase, I will be adding more functionality and more work samples on it. The contact page form is static at this time - WIP!
